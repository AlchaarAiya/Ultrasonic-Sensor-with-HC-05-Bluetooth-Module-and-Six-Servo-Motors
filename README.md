# Ultrasonic-Sensor-with-HC-05-Bluetooth-Module-and-Six-Servo-Motors

This repository contains the circuit for connecting 6 servo motors, an Ultrasonic Sensor, and HC-05 Bluetooth Module.
Moreover, this repo contains the code to control those components. 

The Servo motors will control 2 robot arms, such that each arm has 3 joints, each has a servo motor. 
The Ultrasonic sensor will detect any objects, and if the object remains in the range for more than 3 seconds and is less than 20cm away, the robot program will start.
